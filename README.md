# _localchat
Simple browser-based LAN chat for my flatmates and I. No authentication required. Runs on Flask, made to be as lightweight as possible, to run on a raspi. 

> FLASK : for quick start and personal training. I'll think on switching to another language and framework eventually for ressources saving. 

> AUTHENTICATION : this is designed to be as simple as possible, limited to LAN and for my flatmates and I. There is no risk of anyone faking another's identity, no password is therefore needed. The /index page asks for the username, which is then stored on a cookie, and used to tag messages. 

> MESSAGES : stored on a simple text file.
